# Apple Product Price Analyses and Wayback Machine Scraping

This is a collaborative effort between Rick Walker, Hylton Hollander, and Dawie van Lill to use Apple Product Prices to evaluate some of the puzzles and dynamics pertaining to the law of one price (LOP) and real exchange rates (RER). Specifically, we construct two new datasets consisting of Apple product prices (APPs) - based on scraped data on iPods, iPads and iPhones - and provide new insights into the LOP and deviations from it. The performance, findings and estimates derived by using these datasets are also compared to other (more researched) relative price measures such as the Big Mac index as well as broader price indices used in PPP analyses, e.g. CPI, PPI or WPI. 

### `lopAPP_rep' 

- **Working Paper:**  [Using Apple Products to Evaluate the Law of One Price and Exchange Rate Passthrough](https://doi.org/10.71587/k05tmc37)

- **Description**: Contains the replication files and dataset used in this article. The dataset consists of annual prices for iPods, iPads, and iPhones in nearly 50 countries covering a 14-year period from 2007 to 2020.

### `nonlinearAPP_rep'

- **Working Paper:**  [Nonlinear RER Adjustments: Insights from iPad Price data](https://doi.org/10.71587/zq2kyx44)

- **Description**: Contains the replication files and datasets for investigating nonlinear real exchange rate dynamics using high-frequency (weekly) panel dataset of Apple iPad price data for 35 countries over the period 2016-2021.
