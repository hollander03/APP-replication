### 4. `LOWESS.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: Jupyter notebook implementing locally-weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) for visualizing non-linear trends in real exchange rate adjustments.

### 5. `Piecewise Linear Regressions Panel.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: Jupyter notebook performing piecewise linear regressions to estimate adjustment parameters with breakpoints for real exchange rate deviations.

### 6. `TAR output.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: Jupyter notebook analyzing Threshold Autoregressive (TAR) models to detect and quantify nonlinear adjustments in the data.

### 7. `taroutput.csv`
- **Purpose**: Output dataset from TAR model estimations, containing thresholds and adjustment parameters.

### 8. The Fixed-effect panel threshold model was estimated using the xthreg plugin for Stata. [Wang (2015) DOI: 10.1177/1536867X1501500108](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536867X1501500108)
